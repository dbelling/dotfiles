# .files

This is my system configuration as contained in dotfiles. It was inspired by webpro's [dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/dotfiles). It is tailored towards OSX, but should be modifiable to any flavor of UNIX by substituting `brew` tasks to `apt-get`.

## Overview
Included packages:
* [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) & [homebrew-cask](http://caskroom.io/)
* Node.js & npm
* Python & pip

## Install

### Git Clone

    git clone https://github.com/dbelling/dotfiles.git
    source dotfiles/install.sh
